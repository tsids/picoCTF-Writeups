## Hints

1. Engaging in various decoding processes is of utmost importance

## Solution

The text looks like a base64 encoded string. Decode it using the following command:

```bash
$ cat enc_flag | base64 -d
b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2kyMDRoa2o2fQ=='
```

We see that the output is a string that looks like another base64 encoded string. Decode it again to get the flag.

```bash
$ echo "d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2kyMDRoa2o2fQ==" | base64 -d
wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_i204hkj6}
```

We almost have the flag, but it looks like the text is encrypted using a Caesar cipher. Decrypt it using the following [tool](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher).

Using ROT-19, we get the flag.

## Flag

`picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_b204adc6}`
