## Overview

**Points**: 10

**Category**: [General Skills](../)

## Description
Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](./warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

## Hints

1. This program will only work in the webshell or another Linux computer.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/cfea736820f329083dab9558c3932ada/warm`
3. Run this program by entering the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ ./warm`, but you'll first have to make it executable with `$ chmod +x warm`
4. -h and --help are the most common arguments to give to programs to get more information from them!
5. Not every program implements help features like -h and --help.

## Solution

Download the file and turn it into an executable by running `chmod +x warm`. After that, try running `./warm -h`, and you should get the flag.

Alternatively, you can open the file in a text editor and ctrl + f for "picoCTF".
