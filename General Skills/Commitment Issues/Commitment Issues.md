# [Commitment Issues](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/411?page=3)

## Overview

**Points**: 50

**Category**: [General Skills](../)

## Description

I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!
You download the challenge files here:
- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/137/challenge.zip)

## Hints

1. Version control can help you recover files if you change or lose them!
2. Read the chapter on Git from the picoPrimer [here](https://primer.picoctf.org/#_git_version_control)
3. You can 'checkout' commits to see the files inside them

## Solution

After downloading the zip file, extract it and navigate to the `drop-in` directory. You will find a `.git` directory. This means that the directory is a git repository. Use the `git` command to interact with the repository.

Run `git log` to see the commit history. Notice that there are two commits. Run `git checkout <commit-hash>` to checkout to the commit when the flag was created. Then, `cat` the contents of `message.txt` to see the flag.

```bash
$ git log

To return back to the original commit, run `git switch -`.
