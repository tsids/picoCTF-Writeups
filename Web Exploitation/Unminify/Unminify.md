# [Unminify](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/426)

## Overview

**Category**: [Web Exploitation](../)

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Event**: picoCTF 2024

## Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

## Hints

1. Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

## Solution

Inspect the website and the flag will be in the source code.

Alternatively, use `CTRL+U` to view the source code. Then copy the code and paste it in an [unminifier](https://unminify.com/) to unminify it. Or `CTRL+F` and search for `picoCTF{` until you find the flag.

## Flag

`picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_743d0f9b}`
