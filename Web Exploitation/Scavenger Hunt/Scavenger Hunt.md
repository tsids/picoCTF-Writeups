# [Scavenger Hunt](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/161?page=3)

## Overview

**Points**: 50

**Category**: [Web Exploitation](../)

## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site <http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/>. Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Solution

Click on the what section, and it shows that the site was made using HTML, CSS and JS. That's our clue to check the html, css and js files.

Inspect element or open the source code of the page and you'll find the first part of the flag in the html file.

```
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

Navigate to `mycss.css`, and you'll find the second part of the flag.

```
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

Then, go to the `myjs.js` file, and you'll find a hint that asks how to keep Google from indexing the site.

```
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

The answer is to add a `robots.txt` file, which specifies the [behavior of certain user agents](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt). Navigate to `http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/robots.txt` and you'll find the third part of the flag and the next hint.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

The `.htaccess` file manages Apache server configuration. Navigate to `http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.htaccess` and you'll find the fourth part of the flag and the next hint.

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

In Macs, the `.DS_Store` file is a hidden file that stores the configuration of how the desktop looks (icons, background, etc). Navigate to `http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.DS_Store` and you'll find the last part of the flag.

```
